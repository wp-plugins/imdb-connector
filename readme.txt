A neat plugin that allows you to easily get movie details from IMDb.com.

== Description ==

**IMDb Connector** is a plugin that allows you to easily access the [IMDb.com](http://ww.imdb.com) database through the [API provided by omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com) and get details for a specific movie (for a full list of the returned details, please see [Installation > PHP functions]()).

So far, the plugin comes with the following features:

* [**Widgets**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API) that lets you display the movie details within your sidebar,
* **PHP functions** that allows theme/plugin developers to easily parse information for a specific movie,
* [**Shortcodes**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) which you can use to display one or more details about a movie inside your post or page,
* and a **settings page** that lets you (de)activate features and customize the way IMDb Connector works.

If you have any other ideas for features, please don't hesitate to submit them by [sending me an e-mail](mailto:kolja.nolte@gmail.com) and I'll try my best to implement it in the next version. Your WP.org username will be added to the plugin's contributor list, of course.

*Feel free to make IMDb Connector easier to use for foreign users by [help translating the plugin on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/plugin-imdb-connector/)*.

**Please note that this is an early version, there still may be bugs. If you encounter any problems or misbehaviors while using IMDb Connector, please take a minute to report it via mail to kolja.nolte@gmail.com so that the fix can be implemented in the next version.**

	$movies = get_imdb_movies("Island");
	/** Start building the table */

	echo "<tbody>";
	echo "<tr>";
	echo "<td>Title</td>";
	echo "<td>Year</td>";
	echo "<td>Genre</td>";
	echo "<td>Plot</td>";
	echo "</tr>";
	/** Insert a row for each found movie */
	foreach($movies as $movie) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>" . $movie["title"] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $movie["year"] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $movie["genre"] . "</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $movie["plot"] . "</td>";

	}
	/** Close the table */

`<?php
	$movie_title = $_GET["movie_title"];

	}
?>`

= Shortcodes =
IMDb Connector allows you use shortcodes to display movie details within your post or page by using `[imdb_movie_detail title="" detail=""]` whereas *title* is the title of the targeted movie and *detail* the movie detail that is supposed to be displayed.
