A simple plugin that allows you to easily display and use movie details from IMDb.com.

== Description ==

**IMDb Connector** is a simple plugin that allows you to easily access the [IMDb.com](http://ww.imdb.com) database through the [API provided by omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com) and get details for a specific movie.

So far, the plugin comes with the following features:

* [**Widgets**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API) that lets you display the movie details within your sidebar,
* **PHP functions** that allows theme/plugin developers to easily parse information for a specific movie,
* [**Shortcodes**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) which you can use to display one or more details about a movie inside your post or page,
* and a **settings page** that lets you (de)activate features and customize the way IMDb Connector works.

**For instructions on how to use, examples and additional information, please see [the official documentation](http://www.koljanolte.com/wordpress/plugins/imdb-connector/)**.

If you have any other ideas for features, please don't hesitate to submit them by [sending me an e-mail](mailto:kolja.nolte@gmail.com) and I'll try my best to implement it in the next version. Your WP.org username will be added to the plugin's contributor list, of course (if you provide one).
